## What is this about exactly? 
Head over to the [**Wiki section**](https://github.com/BioniDKU/profile/wiki) to learn more about this! 

## Components
These are the pieces that, through the setup script, will assemble the full experience (which is why internet is required during setup). 
- [**Setup Script**](https://github.com/BioniDKU/setup): Self-explainatory. This was my primary focus of the project when it first started.
- [**Setup Resources**](https://github.com/BioniDKU/resources): The "other-half" of the setup itself, consisting of assets and software that are needed during setup.
- [**Menus System**](https://github.com/BioniDKU/hikaru): The primary driver of the BioniDKU user experience, ensures everything IDKU stays in place and provides utilities to the contestant & challenger.
